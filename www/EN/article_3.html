				<h2>READ AND TAKE NOTES</h2>
				<p>No matter how good the memory is, it is impossible to remember everything read. You never know what can be useful from what you read - interesting facts, historical events, dates, ideas. You can write down impressions about the book, maybe after a while someone will ask your opinion whether it is worth reading the work.</p>
				<h2>WRITE INTERESTING QUOTES</h2>
				<p>Quotes that impressed are best written down. They can be useful for presentations, student work, articles.</p>
				<h2>MAKE A LIST</h2>
				<p>List books you want to read on the list. We heard about an interesting novelty, friends shared their impressions of the read work - we write in the list. Since in a week you can forget. From time to time, browse through the notes, choose what you will read in the near future. When the book is read, cross out. Such recordings will help to evaluate the volume of reading, as well as the authors and genres that you prefer.</p>
				<p>If the goal is to read a large number of books, then you can read several works at the same time. If you prefer to enjoy reading, then you should not do this. Memorized read worse, in the ways of heroes and events.</p>
