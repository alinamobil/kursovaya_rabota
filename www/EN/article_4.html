		<h2><em>Each of us was faced with the need to remember the information we read. Sometimes everything is easy to remember, and sometimes it takes a lot of time and effort. What is the best way to remember what you read? The technique with which you will meet is simple, it includes three stages:</em></h2>
		<h2><em>- impression;</em></h2>
		<h2><em>- associations;</em></h2>
		<h2><em>- reiteration.</em></h2>
		<h2><em>Let's take a detailed look at each step.</em></h2>

				<h2>IMPRESSION</h2>
				<p>Information that makes a strong impression is best remembered. For example, if you read someone’s biography and you are struck by some fact from the life of a famous person, then you will definitely remember him for a long time. The meaning of the technique is to strengthen the impression for better memorization. Pay attention to all interesting, unusual facts, events, descriptions. It helps to strengthen the impression - scrolling the scene in your head, you can even imagine yourself as the main character. This will help to better remember what you read.</p>
				<h2>ASSOCIATIONS</h2>
				<p>Associate what you read with something familiar and famous. Dates are well remembered if they coincide with some significant numbers for you. Names can be tied to consonant words. Remembering new things is easier if associated with something familiar - this rule always works.</p>
				<h2>HOW TO REMEMBER FASTER AND MORE</h2>
				<p>To remember more information and do it quickly, Tsukiyama offers the following methods:</p>
				<p>Often remember what you need to remember. If you don’t remember the name, then every time you see this person, remember what his name is. For starters, you can even write. See - speak to yourself.</p>
				<p>Group information. A person simultaneously remembers a limited amount. Usually 3 to 7 numbers or words. The amount of information that we can easily remember is limited. But it can be increased if grouped according to a certain attribute.</p>

			<div class="article__item">
				<h2>REITERATION</h2>
				<p>The more times you read the information you need, the better you remember. The method is old, but effective. It is suitable for all types of information - from culinary recipes to scientific texts. It is not at all necessary to read a book repeatedly completely. It is enough to read the necessary passages again. Now we know how to learn to memorize what we read - we strengthen impressions, correlate with something known, and repeat. And what ways do you like to read books and memorize what you read? What techniques do you use to remember the necessary information?</p>
				<h2>GETTING RID OF INTERNET ADDICTION</h2>
				<p>Why, remember something, if in a few seconds all the necessary information can be found on the Internet. With this approach, the brain works less, resulting in poor memory, carelessness. Internet addicted people often complain about forgetfulness, inability to remember what is needed. But how to remove the Internet from life? Most people have no idea how to do without the network that we use for communication and work. Try not to get rid of the Internet, but addiction.</p>
				<h2>FILGHTING BRAIN FREEZEES</h2>
				<p>Is memory worsening? Forgetfulness and distraction? What to do? To improve brain function, Tsukiyama advises trying the following:</p>
				<p>We make notes. If you have forgotten something, write it down in detail. First, what still remains in memory, and then new information on this topic. This simple method is quite effective. If this is not done, then soon do not remember anything at all with regard to a topic that has begun to be forgotten.</p>
