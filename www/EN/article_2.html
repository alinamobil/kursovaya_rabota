		<h2><em>What is difficult in reading books - opened, read, closed. If reading is a way to have fun or pass away a free evening, then the above is enough. But if you want to take out something useful, get knowledge and experience, then everything is not so simple. There are many scientific works on the topic "How to read books" by domestic and foreign scientists. Let us dwell on one study, which was published in the 40s by Mortimer Adler, but still relevant today. Adler claimed that there are 4 ways to read books.Of these methods, we will dwell in detail on inspection reading and analytical reading. Both of these methods are relevant for modern man, but not all of them own it.

				<h2>INSPECTION READING</h2>
				<p>The main feature of this method is surface reading. Such a skill can be useful in situations where there is no time for thoughtful reading. For example, when you need to quickly evaluate whether a book is suitable or not, refresh what you have read. So how to learn to read books this way? Inspection reading consists of the following steps:</p>
				<p>  - We read the name, study the cover of the book. By the way, many do not do this, immediately moving on to the content. And in vain. Authors always pay great attention to book design. The external design carries a certain message, guessing which much will become clear without even seeing the text. Of course, this is true only for paper publications.</p>
				<p>  - We study the first pages. To decide if this book is needed, be sure to study the annotation, the preface, and the prologue. Thus, you can get an idea of ​​any book.</p>
				<p>  - We look through the headers and the last lines. This recommendation is for scientific and business literature. After reviewing the end of the book you will find out the main conclusions and decide whether the publication is suitable or not.</p>
				<p>  - We are studying reviews. This is useful, but only if real people write reviews.</p>
				<p>What is all this for? To understand in a few minutes whether this book is needed, whether it is suitable and choose what is needed.</p>

				<h2>ANALYTICAL READING</h2>
				<p>This type of reading will take a lot of time, so it should be used only for works that you want to remember for many years and get everything that the author put into his work. So, how to learn to read books correctly? The analytical method includes the following:</p>
				<p>  - Find out information about the author. The identity of the author is important. For example, if a book on how to achieve material prosperity was written by a person who himself cannot boast of a great fortune, then there will be no trust in the author and his advice.</p>
				<p>  - We spend several minutes studying the book using the inspection method. A brief analysis will not hurt, it will create a preliminary opinion about the work.</p>
				<p>  - We return to difficult and incomprehensible moments. We read the book quickly, without going into individual moments. We mark the text that is interesting or incomprehensible, bookmark it, read it further. The book has been read, and now we return to those fragments that are incomprehensible or interesting. We read carefully, if necessary, we use additional sources for a better understanding.</p>
				<p> - We are writing a resume. After the book is read, we draw up a report. It should contain answers to such questions: what is the book about? What are the main events? Why did they happen? What is the relation to read? Does your opinion coincide with the point of view of the author? What are the findings?</p>
				<p>A similar way of reading can be called work. It requires a lot of time, attention, but it allows you to remember what you read for a long time, to understand the author's ideas. You should not use the analytical method when reading romance novels or detective stories.</p>
