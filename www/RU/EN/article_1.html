	<h2><em>We are used to calling ourselves a reading nation. Unfortunately, surveys conducted show that this is far from the case. Over the past 10 years, the population of our country has begun to read much less, and the quality of the literature read leaves much to be desired. Today we have the opportunity to find many interesting works on the Internet, read books online for free and without registration, but at the same time we read less. So what is the use of reading?</em></h2>

				<h2>VOCABULARY INCREASE</h2>
				<p>If a person reads little, his vocabulary is limited. This fact is confirmed by research. People who read a lot can express their thoughts much more literally, their vocabulary is much larger and more diverse.</p>
				<h2>LEARN NEW</h2>
				<p>Reading allows you to learn new information in various fields - from cooking to technological innovations.</p>
				<h2>EMOTIONS</h2>
				<p>Great writers and poets in their works describe feelings and experiences that we may not have encountered before. We sympathize with the heroes, worry, grieve, rejoice. Empathy appears, which we then experience with real people.</p>
				<h2>BROADENING THE HORIZONS</h2>
				<p>There are many interesting places in the world, but not all of us will be able to visit. But you can read it. Books introduce us to events, interesting facts. We can learn about the lives of great people who have left their mark on history. Each book read broadens our horizons in different areas.</p>
				<h2>ADVICE</h2>
				<p>Family problems? Do not have a relationship with employees? Need information about plants or animals? Want to know more about the countries you plan to travel to? You can always find answers to these and many other questions in books.</p>

				<h2>LITERACY</h2>
				<p>Writing words, turns, the use of literary techniques - all this is remembered when reading. A person who reads a lot, easily expresses thoughts in writing. Conversely, you read a little - the need to write a text will become torture.</p>
				<h2>CONCENTRATION OF ATTENTION</h2>
				<p>Every day more and more people are faced with such a problem as the syndrome of distracted attention. Reading requires concentration and focus.</p>
				<h2>SOURCE OF INSPIRATION</h2>
				<p>Reading is a source for new ideas and achievements. Many successful people began the path to success after reading books, what they read could be a turning point for you.</p>
				<h2>GOOD MOOD</h2>
				<p>People who read a lot have lower levels of stress than non-readers. A great way to escape from everyday worries is an evening spent with a book by a beloved author. To do this, it is better to read something light that will help you forget about the problems and cheer up.</p>
				<h2>BOOK AVAILABILITY</h2>
				<p>Reading is entertainment. Moreover, affordable. Online libraries provide a wide selection of diverse literature for free or at low prices. And what benefit did reading bring you? What else to add to this list?</p>
